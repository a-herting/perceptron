# Perceptron Learning Algorithm
This jupyter project uses the perceptron algorithm. The algorithm takes an input, calculates the weighted sum of the dot product between two vectors w and x. This algorithm is one of 3 algorithms used in linear binary classification. More details about the algorithm can be [found here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/perceptron-learning-algorithm-d5db0deab975). 

For this project, we look at multiple features of the weather.csv dataset with the goal of evaluating the accuracy_score of y_pred using the Perceptron algorithm.
